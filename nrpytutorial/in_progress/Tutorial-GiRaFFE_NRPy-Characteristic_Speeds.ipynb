    "\n",
    "Here, we will find the speeds at which the hydrodynamics waves propagate. We start from the speed of light (since FFE deals with very diffuse plasmas), which is $c=1.0$ in our chosen units. We then find the speeds $c_+$ and $c_-$ on each face with the function `find_cp_cm`; then, we find minimum and maximum speeds possible from among those. A complete derivation of these speeds is included [below](#derive_speed) as an appendix; here, for brevity, we simply start with the implementation of the code in the original `GiRaFFE`. That code itself is adapted from the more general `IllinoisGRMHD` code; we will implement several more simplifications to help improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the source code for `find_cp_cm`, edited to work with the NRPy+ version of `GiRaFFE`. One edit we need to make in particular is to the term `psim4*gupii` in the definition of `c`; that was written assuming the use of the conformal metric $\\tilde{g}^{ii}$. Since we are not using that here, and are instead using the ADM metric, we should not multiply by $\\psi^{-4}$.\n",

    "We could use this code directly, but there's substantial improvement we can make by changing the code into a NRPyfied form. Note the `if` statement; NRPy+ does not know how to handle these, so we must eliminate it if we want to leverage NRPy+'s full power. (Calls to `fabs()` are also cheaper than `if` statements.) This can be done if we rewrite this, taking inspiration from the other eliminated `if` statement documented in the above code block:\n",

    "  cminus = 0.5*(cp+cm-fabs(cp-cm));\n",
    "```\n",
    "This can be simplified further, by substituting `cp` and `cm` into the below equations and eliminating terms as appropriate. First note that `cp+cm = -b/a` and that `cp-cm = detm/a`. Thus,\n",
    "```c\n",
    "  cplus  = 0.5*(-b/a + fabs(detm/a));\n",
    "  cminus = 0.5*(-b/a - fabs(detm/a));\n",
    "```\n",
    "This fulfills the original purpose of the `if` statement in the original code because we have guaranteed that $c_+ \\geq c_-$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with an expression that can be much more easily NRPyfied. So, we will rewrite the following in NRPy+, making only minimal changes to be proper Python. However, it turns out that we can make this even simpler. In GRFFE, $v_0^2$ is guaranteed to be exactly one. In GRMHD, this speed was calculated as $$v_{0}^{2} = v_{\\rm A}^{2} + c_{\\rm s}^{2}\\left(1-v_{\\rm A}^{2}\\right),$$ where the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_{\\rm A}^{2}$ $$v_{\\rm A}^{2} = \\frac{b^{2}}{\\rho_{b}h + b^{2}}.$$ So, we can see that when the density $\\rho_b$ goes to zero, $v_{0}^{2} = v_{\\rm A}^{2} = 1$. Then \n",

    "are simplifications that should save us some time; we can see that $a \\geq 0$ is guaranteed. Note that we also force `detm` to be positive. Thus, `detm/a` is guaranteed to be positive itself, rendering the calls to `nrpyAbs()` superfluous. Furthermore, we eliminate any dependence on the Valencia 3-velocity and the time compoenent of the four-velocity, $u^0$. This leaves us free to solve the quadratic in the familiar way: $$c_\\pm = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$."

Notice that since we eliminated the dependence on velocities, none of the input quantities are different on either side of the face. So, this function won't really do much besides guarantee that `cmax` and `cmin` are positive, but we'll leave the machinery here since it is likely to be a useful guide to somebody who wants to something similar.

In summary, we solve the dispersion relation (in, e.g., the $x$-direction) with a wave vector of $k_\\mu = (-\\omega,k_x,0,0)$. So, we solve the approximate dispersion relation $\\omega_{\\rm cm}^2 = [v_A^2 + c_s^2 (1-v_A^2)]k_{\\rm cm}^2$ for the wave speed $\\omega/k_x$, where the sound speed $c_s = \\sqrt{\\Gamma P/(h \\rho_0)}$, the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_A = 1$ (in GRFFE), $\\omega_{\\rm cm} = -k_\\mu k^\\mu$ is the frequency in the comoving frame, $k_{\\rm cm}^2 = K_\\mu K^\\mu$ is the wavenumber squared in the comoving frame, and $K_\\mu = (g_{\\mu\\nu} + u_\\mu u_\\nu)k^\\nu$ is the part of the wave vector normal to the four-velocity $u^\\mu$.
