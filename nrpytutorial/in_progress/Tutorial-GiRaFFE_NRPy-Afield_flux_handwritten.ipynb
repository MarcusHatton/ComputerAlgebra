    "This notebook documents the function from the original `GiRaFFE` that calculates the flux for $A_i$ according to the method of Harten, Lax, von Leer, and Einfeldt (HLLE), assuming that we have calculated the values of the velocity and magnetic field on the cell faces according to the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM) of [Colella and Woodward (1984)](https://crd.lbl.gov/assets/pubs_presos/AMCS/ANAG/A141984.pdf), modified for the case of GRFFE. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "To properly handle the flux terms and avoid problems with shocks, we cannot simply take a cross product of the velocity and magnetic field at the cell centers. Instead, we must solve the Riemann problem at the cell faces using the reconstructed values of the velocity and magnetic field on either side of the cell faces. The reconstruction is done using the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM) (see [here](Tutorial-GiRaFFE_NRPy-PPM.ipynb)); in this module, we will assume that that step has already been done. Metric quantities are assumed to have been interpolated to cell faces, as is done in [this](Tutorial-GiRaFFE_NRPy-Metric_Face_Values.ipynb) tutorial. \n",

The original GiRaFFE used a 2D version of the algorithm from [Del Zanna, et al. (2002)](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210618); but since we are not using staggered grids, we can greatly simplify this algorithm with respect to the version used in the original `GiRaFFE`. Instead, we will adapt the implementations of the algorithm used in [Mewes, et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06225) and [Giacomazzo, et al.
