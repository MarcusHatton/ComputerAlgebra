    "\n",
    "The differential equations that `GiRaFFE` evolves are written in conservation form, and thus have two different terms that contribute to the time evolution of any conserved quantity $\\mathcal{C}$, the flux term $\\mathcal{F}$ and the source term $\\mathcal{S}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\partial_t \\mathcal{C} + \\partial_i \\mathcal{F}^i = \\mathcal{S} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a high-resolution shock capturing scheme, which solves the Riemann problem using the HLL approximate Riemann solver to implement the above equation, to ensure that sharp features in our GRFFE fields are properly modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GRFFE, the evolution equation for the Poynting (i.e., electromagnetic momentum) flux $\\tilde{S}_i$ is given as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\\partial_t \\tilde{S}_i + \\underbrace{ \\partial_j \\left( \\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} T^j_{{\\rm EM} i} \\right)}_{\\rm Flux\\ term} = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} T^{\\mu \\nu}_{\\rm EM} \\partial_i g_{\\mu \\nu}}_{\\rm Source\\ term}.}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We can then see that, if we rewrite this, the right-hand side (RHS) describing the time evolution $\\partial_t \\tilde{S}_i$ consists of two terms: the flux term and the source term. The flux term in particular can be tricky, as it may be discontinuous due to sharp features that may appear e.g., at current sheets or inside black hole horizons. If we were to simply approximate the term using finite-difference derivatives, such sharp features would lead to a [Gibbs-like phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon). So, we implement a different algorithm to take the derivative.\n",

Critically, these quantities depend on the Valencia 3-velocity $v^i_{(n)}$ and magnetic field $B^i$. We will not be using the usual gridfunctions for these, but rather the ones that we have previously calculated on the left and right sides of the cell faces using the [Piecewise Parabolic Method](Tutorial-GiRaFFE_NRPy_Ccode_library-PPM.ipynb).\n",

In summary, we solve the dispersion relation (in, e.g., the $x$-direction) with a wave vector of $k_\\mu = (-\\omega,k_x,0,0)$. So, we solve the approximate dispersion relation $\\omega_{\\rm cm}^2 = [v_A^2 + c_s^2 (1-v_A^2)]k_{\\rm cm}^2$ for the wave speed $\\omega/k_x$, where the sound speed $c_s = \\sqrt{\\Gamma P/(h \\rho_0)}$, the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_A = 1$ (in GRFFE), $\\omega_{\\rm cm} = -k_\\mu k^\\mu$ is the frequency in the comoving frame, $k_{\\rm cm}^2 = K_\\mu K^\\mu$ is the wavenumber squared in the comoving frame, and $K_\\mu = (g_{\\mu\\nu} + u_\\mu u_\\nu)k^\\nu$ is the part of the wave vector normal to the four-velocity $u^\\mu$.
