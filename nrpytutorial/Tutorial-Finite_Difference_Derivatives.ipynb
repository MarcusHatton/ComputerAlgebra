    "Suppose we have a *uniform* numerical grid in one dimension; say, the Cartesian $x$ direction. Since the grid is uniform, the spacing between successive grid points is $\\Delta x$, and the position of the $i$th point is given by\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "FD techniques are usually constructed as follows:\n",
    "* First, find the unique $N$th-degree polynomial that passes through $N+1$ sampled points of our function $u$ in the neighborhood of where we wish to find the derivative. \n",
    "* Then, provided $u$ is smooth and properly-sampled, the $n$th derivative of the polynomial (where $n\\le N-1$; *Exercise: Justify this inequality*) is approximately equal to the $n$th derivative of $u$. We call this the **$n$th-order finite difference derivative of $u$**. \n",
    "* So long as the function $u$ is smooth and properly sampled, the relative error between the exact and the finite difference derivative $u^{(n)}$ will generally decrease as the polynomial degree or sampling density increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $n$th finite difference derivative of $u(x)$ at $x=x_i$ can then be written in the form\n",
    "$$u^{(n)}(x_i)_{\\text{FD}} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} u_j a_j,$$\n",
    "where the $a_j$'s are known as *finite difference coefficients*. So long as the $N$th-degree polynomial that passes through the $N+1$ points is unique, the corresponding set of $a_j$'s are unique as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to compute the finite difference coefficients $a_j$, including solving for the $N$th-degree polynomial that passes through the function at the sampled points. However, the most popular and most straightforward way involves Taylor series expansions about sampled points near the point where we wish to evaluate the derivative.\n",
