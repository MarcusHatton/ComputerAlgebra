    "# Formulation of Maxwell's Equations in Cartesian Coordinates and Flat Spacetime - An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Terrence Pierre Jacques\n",

    "## This tutorial notebook outlines two formulations of Maxwell's equations.\n",

    "### This module serves as a stepping stone towards solving Einstein's equations using NRPy+. As such, the [tutorial notebook on the scalar wave equation in curvilinear coordinates](Tutorial-ScalarWaveCurvilinear.ipynb) is *required* reading before beginning this module. That module, as well as its own prerequisite [module on reference metrics within NRPy+](Tutorial-Reference_Metric.ipynb) provides the needed overview of how NRPy+ handles reference metrics.\n",

    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "To numerically solve Einstein's equations, a system of coupled, non-linear equations, the spatial coordinates may be decoupled from the time coordinate. In doing so, numerical solutions may be marched forward in time, using the [Method of Lines](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NDSolveMethodOfLines.html) ([NRPy+ tutorial here](Tutorial-Method_of_Lines-C_Code_Generation.ipynb)). This is done using the 3 + 1 decomposition, originally done using the ADM formalism. However, it was found that using this formulation of Einstein's equations resulted in unstable simulations, due to its weakly hyperbolic system of equations. Hyperbolicity is the notion of the wave-like behavior of the numerical solution for a given system of PDE's. The ADM formulation of Einstein's equations involved mixed second derivatives, which give rise to a weakly hyperbolic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the BSSN formalism removes these mixed second derivatives, resulting in a strongly hyperbolic system of equations. In this module, we follow the work of [Knapp, Walker & Baumgarte (2002)](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0201051), showcasing the difference between using strongly versus weakly hyperbolic systems, when solving a physical problem with Maxwell's equations in vacuum.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### A Note on Notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "As is standard in NRPy+, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Greek indices refer to four-dimensional quantities where the zeroth component indicates temporal (time) component.\n",
    "* Latin indices refer to three-dimensional quantities. This is somewhat counterintuitive since Python always indexes its lists starting from 0. As a result, the zeroth component of three-dimensional quantities will necessarily indicate the first *spatial* direction.\n"
