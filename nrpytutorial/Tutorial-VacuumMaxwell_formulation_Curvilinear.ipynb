    "# Formulation of Maxwell's Equations in Curvilinear Coordinates and Flat Spacetime- An Overview\n",

    "## Author: Terrence Pierre Jacques\n",

    "## This tutorial notebook constructs Maxwell's equations in a covariant form.\n",

    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Following [Tutorial-VacuumMaxwell_formulation_Cartesian](Tutorial-VacuumMaxwell_formulation_Cartesian.ipynb) and [Tutorial-Start_to_Finish-Solving_Maxwells_Equations_in_Vacuum-Cartesian notebook](Tutorial-Start_to_Finish-Solving_Maxwells_Equations_in_Vacuum-Cartesian.ipynb), the user will note that solving the system of equations seems computationally wasteful. The toroidal dipole field initial data as implemented in [this tutorial](Tutorial-VacuumMaxwell_InitialData.ipynb) are axisymmetric, so one hardly needs to sample the numerical solution in the $\\phi$ direction. Thus, the numerical solution requires sampling in the $r$ and $\\theta$ directions. Therefore, evolving these initial data in Cartesian coordinates is wasteful, as we do not take advantages of the symmetry of the problem. To do so, we must evolve the system in spherical or cylindrical like coordinate systems, or curvilinear coordinate systems. However, we must then reformulate Maxwell's equations into a covariant form.\n",

    "As is standard in NRPy+, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Greek indices refer to four-dimensional quantities where the zeroth component indicates temporal (time) component.\n",
    "* Latin indices refer to three-dimensional quantities. This is somewhat counterintuitive since Python always indexes its lists starting from 0. As a result, the zeroth component of three-dimensional quantities will necessarily indicate the first *spatial* direction.\n"

    "Our current formulation of Maxwell's equations remains non-covariant, i.e. the forms of the equations will be altered if we move to curvilinear coordinates. To address this issue, and thus allow us to write the equations down in any arbitrary coordinate system, we must rewrite the equations to be manifestly covariant. \n",

    "We begin this process by employing the so-called \"comma goes to semi-colon rule,\" replacing all partial derivatives, which do not transform as tensorial quantities, with covariant derivatives, which do.
