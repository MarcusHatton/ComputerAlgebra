    "The goal of this module is to give the user an overview/understanding of NRPy+'s Unit Testing framework, which will give the user enough information to begin creating their own unit tests. We will begin by giving an overview of the important prerequisite knowledge to make the most out of unit tests. Next, we give an explanation for the user interaction within the unit testing framework; this will give the user the ability to create tests for themselves. Then we give the user some insight into interpreting the output from their unit tests. Finally, a full example using a test module will be run through in full, both with and without errors, to give the user a realistic sense of what unit testing entails.\n",

    "For in-depth explanations of all subfunctions (not user-interactable), see the [UnitTesting Function Reference](./UnitTesting/UnitTesting_Function_Reference.ipynb). This may not be essential to get unit tests up and running, but it will be invaluable information if the user ever wants to make modifications to the unit testing code.\n"

    "What is the purpose of unit testing, and why should you do it? To begin\n",
    "thinking about that, consider what subtleties can occur within your code\n",
    "that are almost unnoticeable to the eye, but wind up giving you an\n",
    "incorrect result. You could make a small optimization, and not notice\n",
    "any change in your result. However, maybe the optimization you made only\n",
    "works on Python 3 and not Python 2, or it changes a value by some tiny\n",
    "amount -- too small to be noticeable at a simple glance, but enough to\n",
    "make a difference in succeeding calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where unit testing comes in. By initially calculating values for\n",
    "the globals of your modules in a **trusted** version of your code and\n",
    "storing those values in a dictionary, you can then easily check if\n",
    "something stopped working correctly by comparing your newly calculated\n",
    "values to the ones you've stored. On the frontend, there are four\n",
    "concepts essential to understand to get your unit tests up and running:\n",
    "`trusted_values_dict`, `create_test`, your testing module (which\n",
    "will simply be referred to as `test_file`), and a bash script (which\n",
    "will simply be referred to as `bash_script`). There is also some\n",
    "important prerequisite knowledge that may be helpful to grasp before\n",
    "beginning your testing. There are many functions at play in the backend\n",
    "as well, all of which are described in the Function Reference. Mastery of these functions may not be\n",

The user should change the name of the function to something relevant to their test. However, note that the name of the function must begin with `test_` in order for the bash script to successfully run the test -- this is the default naming scheme for most test suites/software. Inside the function, multiple fields are required to be filled out by the user; these fields are `module`, `module_name`, and `function_and_global_dict`. Below the function there is some code that begins with `if __name__ == '__main__':`. The user can ignore this code as it does backend work and makes sure to pass the proper information for the test.\n",

    "An important thing to note is that even though `initialization_string` looks odd with its indentation, this is necessary for Python to interpret it correctly. If it was indented, Python would think you were trying to indent that code when it shouldn't be, and an error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question you may be wondering is why we need to create a new dictionary for the intialization string, insted of just passing it as its own argument. This is because the testing suite can accept multiple function calls, each with their own associated global list, in one function. It then naturally follows that we need `initailization_string_dict` to allow each function call to have its own code that runs before its function call. In the following example, the function `BSSN_basic_tensors()` has an initialization string, but the function `declare_BSSN_gridfunctions_if_not_declared_already()` doesn't. You can also clearly see they each have their own associated globals.\n",

    "This seems like a lot to take-in, but it's not too difficult to understand once fairly well acquainted with the output. The beginning is identical to the output from the successful test run, up until `calc_error` is called. This gives the user some insight that there was an error during `calc_error`, which gives an indication that at least one global had a different calculated and trusted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line confirms this suspicion: globals `g4DD[0][0]` and `g4DD[0][1]` had differing trusted and calculated values. This gives the user the **exact** information they're looking for. `g4DD` is a rank-2 tensor as per NRPy+ naming convention, and the user can very easily see the indices that failed. If the user expected this -- say they found a bug in their code that generated this global -- they can then copy the new `trusted_values_dict` entry into their `trusted_values_dict` and comment-out/delete the old entry. Then by re-running the test, there should no longer be an error -- the trusted and calculated values should be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next output tells the user that the test failed, and to examine the test file. This is necessary if theres an unexpected failure -- it will help the user figure out why it occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, additional output is given that tells the user all the test files and their respective functions that failed. This may seem repetitive, but there's a good reason for it. Say 20 modules were being tested, 10 of which had failures. Then to figure out what failed, the user would have to scroll through all the output and keep a mental note of what failed. By printing everything that failed at the very end, the user gets instant insight into what failed; this may help the user figure out why.\n"
