    "# The BSSN Formulation of General Relativity in Generic Curvilinear Coordinates: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Zach Etienne\n",
    "\n",
    "## This tutorial notebook demonstrates how Einstein's equations of general relativity in this formulation are constructed and output within NRPy+.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### As Einstein's equations in this formalism take the form of highly nonlinear, coupled *wave equations*, the [tutorial notebook on the scalar wave equation in curvilinear coordinates](Tutorial-ScalarWaveCurvilinear.ipynb) is *required* reading before beginning this module. That module, as well as its own prerequisite [module on reference metrics within NRPy+](Tutorial-Reference_Metric.ipynb) provides the needed overview of how NRPy+ handles reference metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "NRPy+'s original purpose was to be an easy-to-use code capable of generating Einstein's equations in a broad class of [singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_singularity), curvilinear coordinate systems, where the user need only input the scale factors of the underlying reference metric. Upon generating these equations, NRPy+ would then leverage SymPy's [common-expression-elimination (CSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_subexpression_elimination) and C code generation routines, coupled to its own [single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) functions, to generate highly-optimized C code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Reading/Lectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematical foundations of BSSN and 3+1 initial value problem decompositions of Einstein's equations:\n",
    "    * [Thomas Baumgarte's lectures on mathematical formulation of numerical relativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3uo2R-yu4o&list=PLRVOWML3TL_djTd_nsTlq5aJjJET42Qke)\n",

    "\n",
    "### A Note on Notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "As is standard in NRPy+, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Greek indices refer to four-dimensional quantities where the zeroth component indicates temporal (time) component.\n",
    "* Latin indices refer to three-dimensional quantities. This is somewhat counterintuitive since Python always indexes its lists starting from 0. As a result, the zeroth component of three-dimensional quantities will necessarily indicate the first *spatial* direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a corollary, any expressions involving mixed Greek and Latin indices will need to offset one set of indices by one: A Latin index in a four-vector will be incremented and a Greek index in a three-vector will be decremented (however, the latter case does not occur in this tutorial notebook)."
